# Handwritten Digit Classification using PyTorch

This repository contains a simple implementation of a neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The neural network is built and trained using PyTorch.

## Project Description

The project makes use of the popular MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of 28x28 pixels. The task is to classify these images into the correct digit.

The neural network used for this task is a simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers. PyTorch's efficient tensor computations and automatic differentiation capabilities are used to build and train the network.

## Dependencies
